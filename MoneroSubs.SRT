00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,000 To most people, financial privacy is very important 

00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000 But banks, big corporations, and even governments having their records compromised

00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000 The undeniable conclusion is there is no safe place to conduct private transactions

00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000 Well, there WASN’T one, until now. Meet Monero 

00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000 Monero is a secure, private, untraceable currency 

00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000 With Monero, you are your own bank 

00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000 Only you control and are responsible for your funds 

00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000 Monero is private 

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000 This means businesses can keep their suppliers in secret, 

00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000 as well as citizens escape government repressions, and nosy neighbors or crooks 

00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000 Monero can also be selectively transparent 

00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000 and you can chose who you want to see the transactions 

00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000 Monero is dynamically scalable, which makes it very different from a Bitcoin 

00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000 Also, the block reward will never drop below 0.3 XMR 

00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000 And the nominal inflation will stay at 0.3 XMR per minute 

00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000 Monero is decentralized 

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000 It has an active development community with more than 30 contributors 

00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000 Take back control over your finances and start using Monero today!
